## Hi there

I’m shaping my career in technology by combining Information Systems, Project Management, and software development into a practical and result-driven profile. I work at the crossroads of business and tech, where understanding user needs, platform logic, and delivery structure come together to build digital products that solve real problems.

Through completed professional courses, academic work and hands-on involvement in hospitality and service platforms, I’ve developed a strong foundation in planning, coordination, and digital product execution. My goal is to continue growing as a tech-driven project manager & system designer, someone who bridges teams, translates requirements into systems, and delivers solutions that create value and improve the digital experience.
